/**
 * THE PRESENTING SPONSOR, ON SCREEN.
 *
 * One module for every placement, because the thing that must not drift between
 * them is the LINK and the EVENT — a placement that forgets its `utm_medium` or
 * its `sponsor_click` is invisible in the monthly report, and a placement nobody
 * can measure is one we cannot renew on. Every component here goes through
 * `SponsorMark`, so that cannot be forgotten by adding a surface.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT THE AD PATH, AND DELIBERATELY SO. `AdSlot`/`useAds` render nothing on a
 * touch device, nothing in the Electron build, nothing for a supporter, and
 * nothing when AdSense is unconfigured — which between them is the phone, the
 * desktop app, and the most engaged players on the service. A presenting sponsor
 * was sold the app, not the leftover inventory, so none of these components read
 * `useAds()` at all. The only gate is `sponsorActive()`, i.e. the term.
 */

/** the artwork. Two <img>s, one per theme, in the SAME reserved box.
 *
 *  WHY TWO AND NOT A SWAP: the box is sized from `SPONSOR.logoW/logoH` before
 *  either file has loaded, so nothing moves when they do — `npm run shiftaudit`
 *  fails on any element shifting more than 0.5px, and an image that sizes itself
 *  on load IS that shift. Toggling `src` from JS would also re-request on every
 *  theme change and flash. CSS picks the visible one; the other costs a decode.
 *
 *  ⚠️ THE IN-GAME CHIP THEMES TOO, even though the field underneath it never does.
 *  It is not the field the logo has to read against — it is the chip's own plate,
 *  and that plate is `--ds-hud`, which INVERTS (a white card on the dark field in
 *  light theme, exactly like every other HUD chip). Pinning the light-ink cut there
 *  "because the field is dark" puts a white wordmark on a white card. The cut
 *  follows the PLATE: under the 3D view's scrim that plate is dark in BOTH themes,
 *  so shell.css pins the light-ink cut there (`.game-root.view-3d …`). The one
 *  surface that genuinely does not theme is the burned-in replay mark, whose plate
 *  is painted dark by `replayOverlay.ts` — and that one is canvas, not this.
 *
 *  EXPORTED for `Contributors.tsx`'s "Presented by" credit: that page is not one of
 *  `SPONSOR_PLACEMENTS`, so it renders the artwork through this pure component
 *  rather than through `SponsorMark`, which is the ONE thing allowed to fire the
 *  impression/click events for a contracted placement — see the note there. */

/**
 * THE IMPRESSION, AND HOW LONG IT LASTED.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN IMPRESSION IS NOT A MOUNT, and the difference is the whole number. The
 * footer mark is in the DOM of every shell page whether or not the visitor ever
 * scrolls far enough to see it, and the home lockup is below a 64px title on a
 * short phone. Firing on mount therefore counts views that did not happen, and it
 * inflates exactly the figure the click rate is divided by — so the one number we
 * would be overstating is the one the renewal is argued over. Better to under-count
 * honestly: this fires only after the mark has been at least `VIEWABLE_RATIO` on
 * screen for `VIEWABLE_MS` unbroken, and a backgrounded tab is not on screen.
 *
 * DWELL IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE ANSWER. One impression on a twenty-minute
 * practice session and one on a three-second bounce are the same row in a count of
 * impressions, and they are not the same thing to a sponsor. The in-game chip is
 * the longest-exposure placement in the app and had no way of showing it.
 * Accumulated visible time flushes ONCE per mount — at unmount, or at `pagehide`
 * for the surfaces (the footer) that never unmount because the tab just closed.
 *
 * PRIVACY IS UNCHANGED: the payload is a placement name and a bucket string. No
 * user, no session, no page, no timestamp (`src/analytics.ts`).
