/**
 * Privacy policy + terms pages. Both are the same shape — an eyebrow, a title, a
 * "last updated" line, and one long Markdown body — so they share `LegalPage` and
 * differ only in their copy (`src/legalText.ts`).
 *
 * These render inside the app shell's `.ds-main`, so they return page content only.
 * The `.legal-md` class widens and enlarges the base `.md` type, which is tuned for
 * short announcement cards and reads too tight for a document this long.
 *
 * A live privacy policy is a prerequisite for the AdSense application, so this page
 * must stay reachable without an account and without JavaScript-gated routing.
