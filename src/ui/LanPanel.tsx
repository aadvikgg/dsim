/**
 * LAN PLAY — host a game on this machine, or join one on this network.
 *
 * Matches on a self-hosted server are UNOFFICIAL: never rated, never on a leaderboard. Their
 * replays are still saved to the host's account, which is the whole reason hosting is gated
 * on being signed in. See docs/lan-selfhost.md.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS SCREEN BYPASSES `AppShell`**, the same way `Lobby`'s entry phase does (and for
 * the same reason: the screen it's modeled on has none of the shell's chrome). `App.tsx`
 * renders it as an early return, wrapped in `RoomFriendsLayout` — the exact wrapper `Lobby`
 * uses for its own Friends panel — rather than as a child of `<AppShell>`. One consequence:
 * `LanBanner` (rendered by `AppShell`) doesn't show here, same as it already doesn't show
 * inside `Lobby`'s room screens — the "Connected to …" block below covers that case instead.
 *
 * TWO CONSTRAINTS SHAPE THIS SCREEN, and neither is obvious from looking at it:
 *
 * 1. **HOSTING IS DESKTOP-ONLY.** A web page cannot start a server. The host controls are
 *    ABSENT rather than disabled in a browser, because a disabled button is a promise that
 *    something would enable it, and nothing here would.
 *
 * 2. **AN https PAGE CANNOT OPEN A `ws://` SOCKET.** The browser drops it as mixed content
 *    with no catchable error, so a guest who types a LAN address into the app on
 *    playdsim.com would watch it fail forever with nothing to go on. The Join box detects
 *    that BEFORE connecting and says the one thing that works: open the host's URL in a
 *    browser instead. `localhost` is exempt, which is why the host themselves can play from
 *    the live site.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO REGION PICKER, ON PURPOSE** — unlike the custom-room entry screen this one is
 * modeled on (`Lobby.tsx`'s `phase === 'entry'`). LAN has one machine; offering a region
 * would be offering a choice that does not exist.
 */
/**
 * THE FOUR COMMANDS, in the order a person types them.
 *
 * `git clone` rather than `npx github:...`, which would be one line instead of four. The
 * one-liner needs this package to carry a `prepare` script so npm builds it after cloning,
 * and `prepare` ALSO runs on every ordinary `npm install` — so every contributor would pay a
 * full client build on every install to save a host three lines once. The `bin` entry
 * (`dsim-lan`) exists so the one-liner can be added later if that trade ever changes.
 *
 * `npm ci` rather than `npm install`: the lockfile is committed, and a host is not trying to
 * resolve new versions, they are trying to run the thing.

                  Why this is on the page AT ALL, and why it is not apologetic about the
                  terminal:

                  A browser tab still cannot be a SERVER — there is no web API that opens a
                  listening socket, so nothing a guest types into an address bar will ever
                  reach a tab. What changed is that guests no longer have to dial one: the
                  tab-hosted path above reaches them through WebRTC, introduced by a cloud
                  rendezvous. `docs/lan-webrtc.md`.

                  ⚠️ So this block is NOT the fallback for people who cannot use the button
                  above. It is the path for a venue with NO INTERNET AT ALL, which the tab
                  path needs for about a second to make the introduction. That is a real gym,
                  and it is the reason this stays on the page rather than being deleted now
                  that hosting has a button.

                  GUESTS ARE UNAFFECTED either way, which is the part people assume wrong:
                  only the HOST needs any of this. `docs/lan-selfhost.md` carries the long
                  version. ---------------------------------------------------------------- */}
