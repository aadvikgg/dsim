/**
 * ACCOUNT STANDING, as a MODERATOR edits it.
 *
 * Standing is charged entirely by a server watching sockets: a dodge, an AFK, a walk-out, a
 * brigade of reports. Every one of those is a judgement about a person made from a connection,
 * and some of them are wrong — a router died mid-match, a room crashed and billed everyone in
 * it, four friends reported someone they lost to. Until this panel the honest answer to "that
 * penalty was not mine" was a shrug, which is the single fastest way to make a behaviour
 * system feel arbitrary.
 *
 * THE COMMON CASE IS ONE BUTTON. Almost every time this panel is opened the decision is
 * already made — the penalties were wrong, clear them — so CLEAR ALL INFRACTIONS does the
 * whole thing in one press: every offence voided, the score back to full, the ranked lock
 * lifted. Building that out of three separate controls would mean every pardon is three
 * chances to leave someone half-pardoned, which in practice means locked out with a full
 * score and no idea why.
 *
 * A PARDON VOIDS RATHER THAN DELETES (migration 0036). The offence stops counting toward
 * escalation and stops costing points, and stays in the ledger struck through. Both halves
 * matter: a pardon that left the ladder intact is a pardon in name only, and one that erased
 * the row leaves the next moderator unable to see that this is the fourth.
