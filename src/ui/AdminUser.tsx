/**
 * ONE ACCOUNT, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.
 *
 * The console knew all of this already and kept it in four places that did not know about
 * each other: the Live table had a name, the report queue had counts, the standing editor had
 * the ledger, the user search had the membership. Deciding what to do about somebody meant
 * opening all four and holding the answer in your head — and three of the four had no way to
 * reach the fourth, so the usual move was to copy a uuid between tabs.
 *
 * Now every place a name appears opens this, and every action that can be taken about a
 * person is on it. The panel is deliberately READ-HEAVY at the top and action-light below:
 * the mistake this replaces is a console where the buttons are easy to find and the context
 * that decides which one to press is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN ACCOUNT WITH NO PROFILE ROW STILL OPENS. `known: false` is a real state, not an
 * error — see `AccountName` in `adminBits.tsx` — and it is exactly the state somebody is
 * looking at when they come here from a session that said it was signed in.
