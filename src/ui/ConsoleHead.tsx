/**
 * THE CONSOLE HEADER — Back + the DSIM mark, then the page title with its sub-line — for every
 * full-screen queue/join surface (Ranked, Record run, Custom room, Match strategy, LAN, Discord
 * lobbies). It was hand-copied into each of them (design review 02-01), and the copies had
 * drifted: some subs carried `.ds-sub-tight`, some did not, so title→sub was 12px on one page
 * and 22px on the next, and every sub's own 24px bottom margin stacked on the column's gap.
 *
 * The title and its sub are ONE group (`.ds-title`, its own small gap), so the column's gap
 * spaces the header block from the content the same on every page, with or without a sub.
 * `title` absent ⇒ the header row alone (the builder takeovers, which render `Menu` under it).
