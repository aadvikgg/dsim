/**
 * THE PENALTY LINE — written once, read back once.
 *
 * Every sanction any of the three games issues reaches a human as a line in `world.events`:
 * `MINOR FOUL - BLUE +5 (G424 contact in the gate zone)`. The live HUD pops it as a toast and
 * forgets it, which is all a driver mid-match wants. A REPLAY wants the opposite — the whole
 * list, at the ticks the calls landed, so somebody can see why the score moved — and that
 * means reading the line back apart.
 *
 * A LEAF MODULE HOLDING BOTH HALVES, and that is the point. The alternative was a regex in
 * the viewer matching a template three files away (`src/sim/scoring.ts`, and BIOBUZZ's own
 * tariff wrapper, which mirrors the same text for its 20-point majors), with nothing tying
 * the two together: change "FOUL" to "PENALTY" for the toast and the replay's penalty list
 * silently empties. Here the formatter is the only way a line is written and the parser is
 * the only way one is read, `npm test` round-trips them, and the drift cannot happen.
 *
 * DOM-free and import-free, so the sim, the headless suites and the UI can all have it.
 *
 * ⚠️ These strings are USER-VISIBLE COPY, and they live in `src/sim/`, so changing one is a
 * SERVER change and needs a deploy — the same rule the foul names themselves carry.
