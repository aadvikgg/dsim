/**
 * Whether ads should render right now, for this user.

 * Self-contained on purpose: it reads the auth session and fetches the supporter
 * entitlement itself, so it can wrap the whole app ONCE in `main.tsx`. The game
 * screen renders outside the app shell (`App.tsx` returns it early), so a provider
 * threaded through the shell would miss exactly the surface the ad columns live on.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED. `showAds` starts false and only becomes true once the entitlement
 * check has actually settled. Defaulting the other way would flash ads at a paying
 * supporter on every page load — the one outcome that makes the membership feel
 * broken. A free user pays for that with a beat of empty space, which is cheap.
