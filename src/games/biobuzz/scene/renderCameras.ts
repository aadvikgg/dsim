 *
 * Both cameras are driven ENTIRELY by `frame.viewAngle`, the same angle the shared 2D camera
 * (`src/render/camera.ts`'s `Camera.worldToScreen`) rotates the world by so a driver's own wall
 * reads at the bottom of the screen: `rot(p, viewAngle)` then a y-flip, `screenUpWorld()` =
 * `rot({x:0,y:1}, -viewAngle)`. Re-deriving "which wall does this alliance's driver stand at"
 * from `frame.localRobotId`'s alliance would have to agree with that rotation anyway (BIOBUZZ's
 * 2D field renders under the exact same `Camera`), so this file takes the angle as its one input
 * and never looks up a robot — see `renderScene.ts`'s header for the consequence: a caller that
 * ever wants a viewAngle that is not a clean per-alliance one (a free spectator orbit, say) has
 * nowhere to plug that into a `SceneFrame` today. Noted as a gotcha for the integration lane.

 * fit (reported as `!fits`, never thrown — a slightly-cropped corner beats a broken camera).
 *
 * `aspect` IS THE SAFE RECT'S, not the canvas's (see the safe-rect block below `DriverFit`): the

 * comparisons against the raw numbers (no string key, no allocation at all), which is what

   * THE INVERSE OF `GameScene.project`, for the free camera alone: a cursor in clip space → the
   * FLOOR point (z = 0) it is over, or `null` when there is not one.
   *
   * It unprojects through the camera that was actually RENDERED (`free`, i.e. the eased
   * `freeCurrent`), not through `freeGoal`, because the point under the cursor is a fact about
   * the picture on screen. Clip space is the right input: `setViewOffset` bakes the HUD safe
   * rect into `projectionMatrix`, so NDC from the canvas rect stays correct with chrome up.
   *
   * `null` for the three cases a floor point does not exist or is not useful: a ray parallel to
   * the floor, a ray pointing AWAY from it (the sky above the horizon), and a hit so far outside
   * the field that zooming toward it would be a pan to nowhere — the caller then does an
   * ordinary dolly toward the look-at point.
