/**
 * BIOBUZZ 3D SCENE — the 56 scoring elements, as two `InstancedMesh`es (Day 1,
 * `docs/biobuzz/plan-3d.md` §3.4, §4.2).
 *
 * GEOMETRY. Two per kind, and the cheap one is always built first: a `SphereGeometry` (~176
 * triangles) and, on `elementDetail: 'cad'`, the real perforated CAD solid fetched by
 * `renderElementsGlb.ts` (2,286 / 2,542 triangles, 26 bores). The sphere is what stands while
 * the fetch is in flight and what stands forever if it fails — nothing here awaits, so a scene
 * is never held up by 22 KB and an offline player gets the Day 1 picture rather than no balls.
 *
 * POSITIONING. `ground`/`flight` balls are posed at `(pos.x, pos.y, z + r)` — `z` is already the
 * height ABOVE the tile a resting ball's centre sits at (a resting ground ball reads `z === 0`
 * in `draw.ts`/`play.ts`, so its drawn centre has to be lifted by its own radius; a flight ball's
 * `z` is real altitude). `held`/`stock` balls are off-field and hidden (scaled to zero).
 *
 * `element` balls (parked in a HIVE cell or a FLOWER stack, `state.ts`'s `BallState`) already
 * carry a REAL, useful `pos`/`z` — but WHAT that z means depends on which solve wrote it, so
 * the height adjustment branches on `biobuzzPhysics(world)` and not on the ball's kind; the
 * comment inside `updateBiobuzzElements` has the two conventions and the two bugs. A HIVE cell
 * is the one case `park()` does NOT give a unique
 * position: every element parked in the same cell shares that cell's centre point and a single
 * fixed height (`CELL_MID_Z`, `play.ts`), because "a parked element is not solved and has no
 * position of its own; this is somewhere to point at" (that file's own comment). Rendered
 * verbatim, every pollen in a cell would sit inside every other one. So this file does the ONE
 * approximation the Day 1 brief calls out: it groups a hive's parked elements by their `slot`
 * and fans them out along local x (the cell's un-foreshortened width axis, `BB_HIVE_W`, which a
 * hive tilt does not move since the tilt rotates about world x) — a row, exactly like the 2D
 * renderer's `drawCellContents`, but done from the ball's own (shared) position rather than the
 * `BbHiveState.contents` array (this file never reads `world.biobuzz.hives`).
 *
 * Under `'3d'` every element in the cell already has its own SOLVED position from the tray's
 * Rapier body — there is nothing to fan. Adding the 2D row fan on top of an already-distinct
 * position was itself a bug: measured, it walked a drawn sphere up to ±3.00 in off the body it
 * was meant to mark (5 elements in a cell), drew two elements that physically sit at the same
 * local x 4.5 in apart, and at higher counts pushed the sphere past the floor plate's own edge
 * and through the side wall — read at a glance as "meshing with the hive". The actual small
 * (0.06–0.15 in) penetration into the tray floor is the CONTACT SOLVE's, not this file's — see
 * `sim3d/engineImpl.ts`/`predict.ts`'s `contact_natural_frequency`; this file poses at the body
 * exactly, and does not fudge the draw to hide a physics number.
