/**
 * BIOBUZZ 3D SCENE — the bits EVERY scene in this directory is built the same way from.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There are two Three.js scenes now: the match view (`renderScene.ts`) and the robot-builder
 * turntable (`renderPreview.ts`). They frame completely different things, but a preview whose
 * renderer is set up even slightly differently from the match's is a preview that LIES — the
 * same robot would come out a different colour, because tone mapping, the output colour space
 * and the shadow filter are all per-RENDERER settings and every one of them changes the pixels.
 * That is the drift `docs/roadmap.md` item 1 names as its own risk, and the cheapest way to
 * make it impossible is for there to be exactly one place that makes a renderer and exactly one
 * set of numbers for the light rig.
 *
 * So: the renderer factory, the light-rig constants, the WebGL2 probe, the themed backdrop read
 * and the disposal walk live here, and both scenes import them. Nothing in this file knows what
 * a `World` is; it is renderer plumbing only.

 * trying to create. The builder preview, the thumbnail scene and the match view all share this
 * one answer. (The AUTO-quality first guess is a separate thing and stays in `renderScene.ts`:
 * it applies a graphics preference, which a preview must not do.)

 * A context is lost on a GPU reset, a driver update, a laptop switching graphics card, a tab
 * backgrounded long enough on a memory-pressured phone, or another tab taking the GPU. What the
 * page sees is NOT an exception: every GL call after it becomes a silent no-op and the canvas
 * keeps whatever pixels it last had. So the failure looks like a FROZEN 3D VIEW that still
 * accepts input, with a HUD updating on top of it — which reads as "the game hung", and the one
 * thing a player cannot do about it is find the 2D view, because the field they are looking at
 * has not moved.
 *
 * `preventDefault()` on the event is what makes restoration POSSIBLE at all (without it the
 * browser never fires `webglcontextrestored`). This scene does not restore — every buffer,
 * texture and program would have to be rebuilt — it hands the loss to the host, which takes the
 * same route the `SceneUnsupportedError` fallback takes: this tab falls back to 2D (`fallBackTo2d`, never stored) and a
 * line goes to the event log. That is a live game a click later instead of a dead canvas.
 *
 * Returns the REMOVER, for the caller's teardown list. A scene that is disposed and remounted
 * (a view switch, a restart) would otherwise leave a listener holding a closure over a dead
 * scene on a canvas that has been detached.
